# terraform-provider-dare

The Terraform Encryption provider is a plugin for Terraform that allows for encryption/decryption of artifacts. think of it as `ansible-vault` in terraform provider format. 

While I have used [`anubis-vault`](https://github.com/da-moon/anubis-vault) for encrypting artifacts like certificates in-production for +6 months which is backed by the same [library](https://github.com/da-moon/go-dare) as this provider, I make no guarantees. Use at your own risk.
